This repository contains a simple prototype for an intelligent literature tracking website. It demonstrates a minimal Flask application with three pages:

- **Recent Papers**: a grid view showing placeholder papers.
- **User Preferences**: a personal page for managing subscriptions (placeholder).
- **Paper Detail**: a page showing enhanced summaries for a single paper.

## Running the application

1. Install dependencies (Flask):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` to see the interface.

This code is a starting point for building the full-featured platform described in the specification.
